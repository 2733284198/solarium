    <title>Ping Query</title>
    <para>A ping query can be used to check the connection to the Solr server and the health of the Solr server. It's not just a network ping, it will execute a query to check Solr health. You can set this query in the Solr config with the 'pingQuery' directive.</para>
    <caution>It's not advisable to check Solr with a ping before every request, this can have a big performance import. You are better of using the ping query with intervals, or as a check after a query error to see if the query was faulty or if Solr has problems.</caution>
